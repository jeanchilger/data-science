"An automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) method and system using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the quantitative analysis of image data. Three separate ANNs were applied for detection of interstitial disease on digitized two-dimensional chest images. The first ANN was trained with horizontal profiles in regions of interest (ROIs) selected from normal and abnormal chest radiographs. The second ANN was trained using vertical output patterns obtained from the 1.sup.st ANN for each ROI. The output value of the 2.sup.nd ANN was used to distinguish between normal and abnormal ROIS with interstitial infiltrates. If the ratio of the number of abnormal ROIs to the total number of all ROIs in a chest image was greater than a certain threshold level, the chest image was considered abnormal. In addition, the third ANN was applied to distinguish between normal and abnormal chest images where the chest image was not clearly normal or abnormal. The ANN trained with image data learns some statistical properties associated with interstitial infiltrates in chest radiographs. In addition, the same technique can be applied to higher-dimensional data (e.g., three-dimensional data and four-dimensional data including time-varying three-dimensional data).",Apparatus and method for computerized analysis of interstitial infiltrates in chest images using artificial neural networks

"A pseudo-analog electronic or optoelectronic neuron stores synaptic weights as analog quantities, preferably as charges upon capacitors or upon the gates of floating gate transistors. Multiplication of a stored synaptic weight times a binary pulse-width-modulated synapse input signal periodically produces electrical charge of a first polarity on a first synapse capacitor. Meanwhile a fixed charge of opposite polarity is periodically produced at the same frequency upon another, second, synapse capacitor. The charges on both synapse capacitors at many synapses are periodically accumulated, and integrated, at a single neuron soma in the form of pulse-amplitude-modulated charge-encoded signals. This accumulation, and integration, transpires continuously progressively by a switched-capacitor technique, and during the entire duration of the input signal to each synapse. The net final result, expressed in signed electrical charge, is converted back to a PWM binary signal for transmission to further neurons. A fully capacitive synapse typically occupies a compact area of 45.lambda..times.42.lambda., consumes less than 2 .mu.W dynamic power (at 1 MHz) and offers more than 90% of the full voltage scale for linear weight adaptation. It is therefore well suited to large scale parallel implementations of adaptive neural networks.",Artificial neuron with switched-capacitor synapses using analog storage of synaptic weights

"A database often contains sparse, i.e., under-represented, conditions which might be not represented in a training data set for training an analytical model if the training data set is created by stratified sampling. Sparse conditions may be represented in a training set by using a data set which includes essentially all of the data in a database, without stratified sampling. A series of samples, or &#8220;windows,&#8221; are used to select portions of the large data set for phases of training. In general, the first window of data should be a reasonably broad sample of the data.

""" The present invention relates to the interrelationships between nature (as mediated by evolution and genetic algorithms) and nurture (as mediated by gradient-descent supervised learning) in a population of neural networks for pattern recognition. The Baldwin effect is demonstrated that learning can change the rate of evolution of the population's genome - a """"pseudo-Lamarkian"""" process, in which information learned is ultimately encoded in the genome by a purely Darwinian process. Selectivity is shown for this effect: too much learning or too little learning in each generation leads to slow evolution of the genome, whereas an intermediate amount leads to most rapid evolution. For a given number of learning trials throughout a population, the most rapid evolution occurs if different individuals each receive a different number of learning trials, rather than the same number. Because all biological networks possess structure due to evolution, it is important that such interactions between learning and evolution be understood. Hybrid systems can take advantage both of gradient descents (learning) and large jumps (genetic algorithms) in very complicated energy landscapes and hence may play an increasingly important role in the design of artificial neural systems.

"Described herein is a method and system for training nonlinear adaptive filters (or neural networks) which have embedded memory. Such memory can arise in a multi-layer finite impulse response (FIR) architecture, or an infinite impulse response (IIR) architecture.

For these dynamic architectures, we describe how one can apply optimization techniques which make updates closer to the Newton direction than those of a steepest descent method, such as backpropagation. We detail a novel adaptive modified Gauss-Newton optimization technique, which uses an adaptive learning rate to determine both the magnitude and direction of update steps. For a wide range of adaptive filtering applications, the new training algorithm converges faster and to a smaller value of cost than both steepest-descent methods such as backpropagation-through-time, and standard quasi-Newton methods.

"To avoid the problem of category assignment in artificial neural networks (ANNs) based upon a mapping of the input space (like ROI and KNN algorithms), the present method uses &#8220;probabilities&#8221;. Now patterns memorized as prototypes do not represent categories any longer but the &#8220;probabilities&#8221; to belong to categories. Thus, after having memorized the most representative patterns in a first step of the learning phase, the second step consists of an evaluation of these probabilities. To that end, several counters are associated with each prototype and are used to evaluate the response frequency and accuracy for each neuron of the ANN. These counters are dynamically incremented during this second step using distances evaluation (between the input vectors and the prototypes) and error criteria (for example the differences between the desired responses and the response given by the ANN).

"A system for determining the location of a mobile station based upon measurable mobile data values such as those provided by mobile-assisted handoff (MAHO) procedures. The mobile stations make signal strength measurements of nearby base stations and return that information to the serving base station. A timing advance necessary to synchronize the mobile may also be determined. The signal strength measurements and the timing advance data then provide information to map to an estimated vehicle location. Since the mobiles are assumed to measure signal strength discretely, there may be several consecutive positions along a road which return identical mobile data. The road is thus segmented into constant segements which are consecutively indexed, and an association is established between the associated mobile data vector and the index. The process for location of a mobile consists of first finding the road for the mobile unit, then finding the position along the road. The mobile vector is sequentially input into a look up table or neural networks (one for each road in the sector) until an output coordinate pair actually lies near the corresponding road.

"Fully automated methods and systems for processing complex data sets to identify abnormalities are described. In one embodiment, the system includes wavelet processing, recursive processing to determine prominent features, and then utilizing feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) to classify feature vectors generated in the wavelet and recursive processing. With respect to wavelet processing, multiresolution (five-level) and multidirection (two-dimensional) wavelet analysis with quadratic spline wavelets is performed to transform each image. The wavelets are a first-order derivative of a smoothing function and enhance the edges of image objects. Because two-dimensional wavelet transforms quantize an image in terms of space and spatial frequency and can be ordered linearly, the data is processed recursively to determine prominent features. A neural network approach derived from sequential recursive auto-associative memory is then used to parse the wavelet coefficients and hierarchy data. Since the wavelet coefficients are continuous, linear output instead of sigmoidal output is used. This variation is therefore referred to as linear output sequential recursive auto-associative memory, or LOSRAAM. The objective of training the LOSRAAM network is to have the output exactly match the input. Context units arising from serial evaluation of the wavelet coefficient triplets may be collected as vectors. These vectors are subjected to cluster analysis. This analysis yields a number of identifiable and discrete states. From these states, feature vectors are created. Each element in the feature vector represents the number of times the corresponding state from the above cluster analysis is found. Then, feed forward neural networks (FFNNs) are trained to classify feature vectors.",Neural network based methods and systems for analyzing complex data

"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a distributed computing model in which computation is accomplished using many simple processing units (called neurons) and the data embodied by the connections between neurons (called synapses) and the strength of these connections (called synaptic weights). An attractive implementation of ANNs uses the conductance of non-volatile memory (NVM) elements to code the synaptic weight. In this application, the non-idealities in the response of the NVM (such as nonlinearity, saturation, stochasticity and asymmetry in response to programming pulses) lead to reduced network performance compared to an ideal network implementation.

"A neuronal phase-locked loop (NPLL) that can decode temporally-encoded information and convert it to a rate code is based on an algorithm similar to that of the electronic PLL, but is a stochastic device, implemented by neural networks (real or simulated). The simplest embodiment of the NPLL includes a phase detector (that is, a neuronal-plausible version of an ideal coincidence detector) and a controllable local oscillator that are connected in a negative feedback loop. The phase detector compares the firing times of the local oscillator and the input and provides an output whose firing rate is monotonically related to the time difference. The output rate is fed back to the local oscillator and forces it to phase-lock to the input. Every temporal interval at the input is associated with a specific pair of output rate and time difference values; the higher the output rate the further the local oscillator is driven from its intrinsic frequency. Sequences of input intervals, which, by definition, encode input information, are thus represented by sequences of firing rates at the NPLL's output. The NPLL is an adaptive device which can deal with signals whose exact characteristics are not known in advance and can adapt to changing conditions.",Neuronal phase-locked loops

A number of different neural network pattern matching schemes may be used to perform the necessary speech coding. An integrated user interface guides a user unfamiliar with the details of speech recognition or neural networks to quickly develop and test a neural network for phoneme recognition.

"In the computer interpretation of seismic data, the critical first step is to identify the general class of an unknown event.

This pre-processed input is fed into the SONNs. These neural networks are able to group events that look similar. The ART SONN has an advantage in classifying the event because the types of cluster groups do not need to be pre-defined. The results from the SONNs together with an expert seismologist's classification are then used to derive event classification probabilities.",Seismic event classification system

"A system and method for predicting oil reservoir properties throughout the reservoir using well data and seismic data. While the reservoir properties in the vicinity of a well borehole are usually known (i.e. by well logging), the reservoir properties between wells are unknown and difficult to estimate. Because the relationships between reservoir properties and seismic data is seldom obvious, the method uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN's) to estimate these relationships. First, the method calculates the intersections between the seismic data and wellbore date, i.e. seismic reflectors are correlated to geological markers in the wellbores. Second, the method estimates the significance between seismic attributes and borehole properties. Next, the method models or calibrates the relationship between reservoir properties and seismic attributes by training an ANN using seismic attributes and wellbore data close to the intersections. Finally, the trained ANN uses the seismic attributes to predict the reservoir properties between wells. Advantageously, statistic methods are used to estimate the confidence of the predictions.",System and method of predicting reservoir properties
